# miniVAR: VQ-VAE + PixelCNN

This repository is a lightweight, teaching-scale re-implementation of the main idea from **Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR)**: a coarse-to-fine, next-scale prediction pipeline. Instead of heavy DiT transformers, we plug in a simple PixelCNN with a small “stage” embedding to condition on previous scales.


<!-- ## Features
- **VQ-VAE**: Discrete latent representation learning for images
- **PixelCNN**: Powerful autoregressive prior over VQ-VAE latents
- **Multi-scale training**: Support for hierarchical latent structures
- **WandB integration**: Track experiments and visualize losses
- **Visualization tools**: Sample generation, reconstructions, and training curves
- **Configurable**: All hyperparameters and model settings in `config.py` -->

## ✅ What’s Done
- [x] **VectorQuantizer** with classic straight-through loss + small MLPs φ_i for multi-scale canvas accumulation.
- [x] **VQ-VAE:** convolutional encoder/decoder for MNIST (28×28→7×7 latents).
- [x] Lightweight **PixelCNN** with masked convolutions (A → B), purely unconditional.
- [x] Conditional “stage” embedding that tells the model which up-sampling step it’s at (1→2, 2→4, 4→7).
- [x] At each scale, we upscale previous indices, one-hot, add stage embedding, predict next indices.  

## 🔧 What Can Be Improved (for future)
- [ ] Replace PixelCNN with a small Transformer or DiT block for richer inductive bias.
- [ ] Try on CIFAR-10 or a small face dataset to see generative power beyond MNIST.
- [ ] Experiment with more scales (e.g. 1→3→7→14→28).
